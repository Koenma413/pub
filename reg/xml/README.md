# Smart Objects

IPSO Smart Object Guidelines provide a common design pattern, an object model, that can effectively use the IETF CoAP protocol to provide high level interoperability between Smart Object devices and connected software applications on other devices and services. 

This object set is intended to be used as a starting place from which to build more as needed Some of the objects are generic in nature, such as voltage, altitude or percentage, while others are more specialized like the Color Object or the Gyrometer Object. Actuators and Controllers are defined such as timer or buzzer and Joystick and Level. All of these objects were found to be necessary on a variety of use case domains.
