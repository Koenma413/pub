  "body": "### Welcome to the public IPSO Repository.\r\nHere you can find the [IPSO Smart Object Registry](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/pub/tree/master/reg) with the current object set. The registry is intended for developers that are building products based on IPSO Objects, it is not intended to be used at runtime by applications. \r\n\r\nSome of the objects are generic in nature, such as voltage, altitude or percentage, while others are more specialized like the Color Object or the Gyrometer Object. Actuators and Controllers are also defined such as timer or buzzer and Joystick and Level. All of these objects were found to be necessary on a variety of use case domains.\r\n\r\n### Object Representation\r\n\r\nObjects and resources are implicitly mapped into the URI path hierarchy by following the OMA LWM2M object model, in which each URI path component sequentially represents the Object Type ID, the Object Instance ID and the Resource Type ID. More precisely the structure consists of three unsigned 16-bit integers separated by the character '/':\r\n\r\n```\r\n<object ID>/<object instance ID>/<resource ID>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, a temperature sensor example URI would be `3303/0/5700`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3300  -> Temperature Sensor\r\n0     -> instance 0 of a Temperature Sensor\r\n5700  -> resource having the current value or recent reading\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Object Validation\r\nAnybody can use composition to create new Objects from the existing ones. You would just need to validate them before submitting new ones. You can use 'xmllint' to validate against the [LWM2M Schema](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/tech/profiles/LWM2M.xsd).\r\n\r\n~~~ sh\r\n# Run xmllint against one or multiple Objects Object \r\n$ xmllint --noout --schema LWM2M.xsd example.xml\r\n# The output should be:\r\n$ example.xml validates\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nYou can check the [documentation](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/pub/docs/) for the public documents we have released. Also the [README](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/pub) has more introductory material. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving issues with the Objects, then please report them at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/pub/issues) or contact @jaimejim and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.",
